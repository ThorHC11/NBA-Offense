# NBA-Offense
A project analyzing the high-scoring reality of modern professional basketball.

## Overview
The NBA has experienced an offensive surge over the course of the past decade, and everyone will have their own opinion of why. In this project, I use Python - including Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib - to analyze the higher offensive outputs of the modern NBA. Project includes explanations of basketball statistics to enable understanding for all, even those not well-versed in basketball or sports in general. Analysis is done via sorting player efficiency data into tables separated by season, and graphing of various offensive statistics from 1979 to 2019, as well as correlation testing to determine which changes are related to one another.

This project is my own original work.
